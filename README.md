# CaloriesCounter

Calories counter in react native by NathanaÃ«l Bosquet--Lefebvre and Benjamin Blitz

This project was done with the help of React Native documentation available here : https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

You can run the project by first installing all the packages with the command "npm install" or "yarn install" in the project folder.
Once all the dependencies are installed, use the command "npx expo start" in the terminal while in the project folder.

You can start by filling your personal information in the "Health" tab, remember you have to be at least 15 to use the application.

Once every information is filled, you can check the confirm checkbox and submit so that the application can calculate your Total Caloric Intake.

The next tab is the "Food" tab where you can search for your meals and see how much calories each meal contains.
By pressing the "+", you can add the meal to the planning.

Speaking of the planning, the third tab is the "Planning" tab, where you can add your meals for each day (by sliding to the day you want and pressing the "+" at the bottom).
Pressing the "+" will direct you to the "Food" tab where you can search the meal you want to add and will open a picker to chose either the meal is for the breakfast, lunch, snack or dinner. Once you added what you neededed, the total calories of the meal will be shown at the right of the app.
You can also see the total calories at the top so you can know how many calories you ate for the day.
